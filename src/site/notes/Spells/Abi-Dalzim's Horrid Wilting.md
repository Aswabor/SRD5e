# Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting
*A 8th Level Necromancy Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 150 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a bit of sponge)

**Duration:** Instant

You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. Constructs and undead aren't affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes {@damage 12d8} necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
