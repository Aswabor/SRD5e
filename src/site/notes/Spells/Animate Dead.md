# Animate Dead
*A 3rd Level Necromancy Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Minute

**Range:** Point, 10 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)

**Duration:** Instant

This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a {@creature skeleton} if you chose bones or a {@creature zombie} if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature's game statistics).

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.
