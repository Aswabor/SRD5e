# Astral Projection
*A 9th Level Necromancy Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Hour

**Range:** Point, 10 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Special

You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is {@condition unconscious} and in a state of suspended animation, it doesn't need food or air and doesn't age.
