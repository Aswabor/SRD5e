# Augury
*A 2nd Level Divination Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Minute

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** V S M(specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)

**Duration:** Instant

By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:



{'type': 'list', 'items': ['Weal, for good results', 'Woe, for bad results', 'Weal and woe, for both good and bad results', "Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad"]}



The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.



If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative {@chance 25|25 percent} chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.
