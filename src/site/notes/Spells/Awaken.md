# Awaken
*A 5th Level Transmutation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 8 Hour

**Range:** Point, Touch

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Instant

After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the {@creature awakened shrub} or the {@creature awakened tree}.
