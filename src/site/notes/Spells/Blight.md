# Blight
*A 4th Level Necromancy Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 30 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Instant

Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes {@damage 8d8} necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.



If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.



If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 8d8|4-9|1d8} for each slot level above 4th.
