# Booming Blade
*A Evocation Cantrip.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Radius, 5 Feet

**Components:** S M(a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Round

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes {@damage 1d8} thunder damage, and the spell ends.
