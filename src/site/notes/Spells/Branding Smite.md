# Branding Smite
*A 2nd Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Bonus

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra {@damage 2d6} radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it's {@condition invisible}, and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can't become {@condition invisible} until the spell ends.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d6|2-9|1d6} for each slot level above 2nd.
