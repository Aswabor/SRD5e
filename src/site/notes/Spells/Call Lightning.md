# Call Lightning
*A 3rd Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 120 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Minutes

A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d10|3-9|1d10} for each slot level above 3rd.
