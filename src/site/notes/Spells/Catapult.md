# Catapult
*A 1st Level Transmutation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 60 Feet

**Components:** S 

**Duration:** Instant

Choose one object weighing 1 to 5 pounds within range that isn't being worn or carried. The object flies in a straight line up to 90 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take {@damage 3d8} bludgeoning damage.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight of objects that you can target with this spell increases by 5 pounds, and the damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d8|1-9|1d8}, for each slot level above 1st.
