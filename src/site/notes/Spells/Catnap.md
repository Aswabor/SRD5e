# Catnap
*A 3rd Level Enchantment Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 30 Feet

**Components:** S M(a pinch of sand)

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Minutes

You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall {@condition unconscious} for the spell's duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains {@condition unconscious} for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.
