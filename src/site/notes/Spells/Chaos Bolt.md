# Chaos Bolt
*A 1st Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 120 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Instant

You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 2d8 + 1d6} damage. Choose one of the {@dice d8}s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.
{'type': 'table', 'caption': 'Chaos Bolt', 'colLabels': ['{@dice d8}', 'Damage Type'], 'colStyles': ['col-2 text-center', 'col-10'], 'rows': [[{'type': 'cell', 'roll': {'exact': 1}}, 'Acid'|{'type': 'cell', 'roll': {'exact': 1}}, 'Acid']]}
If you roll the same number on both {@dice d8}s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.
A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes {@scaledamage 2d8 + 1d6|1-9|1d6} extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.
