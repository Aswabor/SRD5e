# Chill Touch
*A Necromancy Cantrip.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 120 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Round

You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 1d8} necrotic damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.
