# Circle of Death
*A 6th Level Necromancy Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 150 Feet

**Components:** V S M(the powder of a crushed black pearl worth at least 500 gp)

**Duration:** Instant

A sphere of negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot-radius sphere from a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes {@damage 8d6} necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 8d6|6-9|2d6} for each slot level above 6th.
