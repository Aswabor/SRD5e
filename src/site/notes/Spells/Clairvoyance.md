# Clairvoyance
*A 3rd Level Divination Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 10 Minute

**Range:** Point, 1 Miles

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Minutes

You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can't be attacked or otherwise interacted with.
