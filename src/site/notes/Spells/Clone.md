# Clone
*A 8th Level Necromancy Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Hour

**Range:** Point, Touch

**Components:** V S M(a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp and at least 1 cubic inch of flesh of the creature that is to be cloned, which the spell consumes, and a vessel worth at least 2,000 gp that has a sealable lid and is large enough to hold the creature being cloned, such as a huge urn, coffin, mud-filled cyst in the ground, or crystal container filled with salt water)

**Duration:** Instant

This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside the vessel used in the spell's casting and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.
