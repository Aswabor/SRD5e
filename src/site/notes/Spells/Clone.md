# Clone
*A 8th Level Necromancy Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Hour

**Range:** Point, Touch

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Instant

This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside the vessel used in the spell's casting and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.
