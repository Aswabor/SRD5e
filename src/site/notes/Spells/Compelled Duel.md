# Compelled Duel
*A 1st Level Enchantment Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Bonus

**Range:** Point, 30 Feet

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

You attempt to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn't restrict the target's movement for that turn.
