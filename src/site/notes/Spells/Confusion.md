# Confusion
*A 4th Level Enchantment Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 90 Feet

**Components:** V S M(three nut shells)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.
