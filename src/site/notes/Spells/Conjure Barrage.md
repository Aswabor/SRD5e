# Conjure Barrage
*A 3rd Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Cone, 60 Feet

**Components:** V S M(one piece of ammunition or a thrown weapon)

**Duration:** Instant

You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition into the air to create a cone of identical weapons that shoot forward and then disappear. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 3d8} damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.
