# Conjure Elemental
*A 5th Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Minute

**Range:** Point, 90 Feet

**Components:** V S M(burning incense for air, soft clay for earth, sulfur and phosphorus for fire, or water and sand for water)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Hour

You call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An {@filter elemental of challenge rating 5 or lower|bestiary|challenge rating=[&0;&5]|type=elemental|miscellaneous=!swarm} appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a {@creature fire elemental} emerges from a bonfire, and an {@creature earth elemental} rises up from the ground. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.
