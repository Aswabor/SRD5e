# Contact Other Plane
*A 5th Level Divination Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Minute

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take {@damage 6d6} psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speak only in gibberish. A {@spell greater restoration} spell cast on you ends this effect.
