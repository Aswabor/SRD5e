# Contingency
*A 6th Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 10 Minute

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Days

Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a contingency cast with {@spell water breathing} might stipulate that {@spell water breathing} comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
