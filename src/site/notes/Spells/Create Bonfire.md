# Create Bonfire
*A Conjuration Cantrip.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 60 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire's space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 1d8} fire damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the bonfire's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.



The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn or carried.



The spell's damage increases by {@dice 1d8} when you reach 5th level ({@damage 2d8}), 11th level ({@damage 3d8}), and 17th level ({@damage 4d8}).
