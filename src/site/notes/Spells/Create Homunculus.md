# Create Homunculus
*A 6th Level Transmutation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Hour

**Range:** Point, Touch

**Components:** V S M(clay, ash, and mandrake root, all of which the spell consumes, and a jewel-encrusted dagger worth at least 1,000 gp)

**Duration:** Instant

While speaking an intricate incantation, you cut yourself with a jewel-encrusted dagger, taking {@damage 2d4} piercing damage that can't be reduced in any way. You then drip your blood on the spell's other components and touch them, transforming them into a special construct called a {@creature homunculus}.
