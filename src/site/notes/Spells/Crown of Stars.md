# Crown of Stars
*A 7th Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Hour

Seven star-like motes of light appear and orbit your head until the spell ends. You can use a bonus action to send one of the motes streaking toward one creature or object within 120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 4d12} radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, the mote is expended. The spell ends early if you expend the last mote.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the number of motes created increases by two for each slot level above 7th.
