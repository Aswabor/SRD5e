# Danse Macabre
*A 5th Level Necromancy Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 60 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Hour

Threads of dark power leap from your fingers to pierce up to five Small or Medium corpses you can see within range. Each corpse immediately stands up and becomes undead. You decide whether it is a {@creature zombie} or a {@creature skeleton} (the statistics for {@creature zombie||zombies} and {@creature skeleton||skeletons} are in the Monster Manual), and it gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you animate up to two additional corpses for each slot level above 5th.
