# Delayed Blast Fireball
*A 7th Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 150 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by {@scaledamage 12d6|7-9|1d6} for each slot level above 7th.
