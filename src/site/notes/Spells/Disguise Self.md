# Disguise Self
*A 1st Level Illusion Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Hour

You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
