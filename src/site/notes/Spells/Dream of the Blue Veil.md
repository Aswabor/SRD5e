# Dream of the Blue Veil
*A 7th Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 10 Minute

**Range:** Point, 20 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a magic item or a willing creature from the destination world)

**Duration:** Timed, 6 Hours

You and up to eight willing creatures within range fall {@condition unconscious} for the spell's duration and experience visions of another world on the Material Plane, such as Oerth, Toril, Krynn, or Eberron. If the spell reaches its full duration, the visions conclude with each of you encountering and pulling back a mysterious blue curtain. The spell then ends with you mentally and physically transported to the world that was in the visions.
