# Eldritch Blast
*A Evocation Cantrip.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 120 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Instant

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 1d10} force damage.
The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.
