# Encode Thoughts
*A Enchantment Cantrip.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** S 

**Duration:** Timed, 8 Hours

Putting a finger to your head, you pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.
