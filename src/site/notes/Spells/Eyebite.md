For the spell's duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with dread power.

{'type': 'entries', 'name': 'Asleep', 'entries': ['The target falls {@condition unconscious}. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.']}
{'type': 'entries', 'name': 'Panicked', 'entries': ['The target is {@condition frightened} of you. On each of its turns, the {@condition frightened} creature must take the {@action Dash} action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.']}
