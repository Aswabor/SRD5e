# Find Familiar
*A 1st Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Hour

**Range:** Point, 10 Feet

**Components:** V S M(10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)

**Duration:** Instant

You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: {@creature bat}, {@creature cat}, {@creature crab}, {@creature frog} (toad), {@creature hawk}, {@creature lizard}, {@creature octopus}, {@creature owl}, {@creature poisonous snake}, fish ({@creature quipper}), {@creature rat}, {@creature raven}, {@creature sea horse}, {@creature spider}, or {@creature weasel}. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.
