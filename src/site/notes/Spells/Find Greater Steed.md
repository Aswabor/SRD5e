# Find Greater Steed
*A 4th Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 10 Minute

**Range:** Point, 30 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Instant

You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a loyal, majestic mount. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the spirit takes on a form you choose: a {@creature griffon}, a {@creature pegasus}, a {@creature peryton}, a {@creature dire wolf}, a {@creature rhinoceros}, or a {@creature saber-toothed tiger}. The creature has the statistics provided in the Monster Manual for the chosen form, though it is a celestial, a fey, or a fiend (your choice) instead of its normal creature type. Additionally, if it has an Intelligence score of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.
