# Find Steed
*A 2nd Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 10 Minute

**Range:** Point, 30 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Instant

You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a {@creature warhorse}, a {@creature pony}, a {@creature camel}, an {@creature elk}, or a {@creature mastiff}. (Your DM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.
