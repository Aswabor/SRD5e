# Find the Path
*A 6th Level Divination Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Minute

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Day

This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn't specific (such as "a green dragon's lair"), the spell fails.
