# Fire Shield
*A 4th Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** V S M(a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Minutes

Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.



The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.



In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes {@damage 2d8} fire damage from a warm shield, or {@damage 2d8} cold damage from a cold shield.
