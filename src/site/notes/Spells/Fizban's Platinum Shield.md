# Fizban's Platinum Shield
*A 6th Level Abjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Bonus

**Range:** Point, 60 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a platinum-plated dragon scale, worth at least 500 gp)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

You create a field of silvery light that surrounds a creature of your choice within range (you can choose yourself). The field sheds dim light out to 5 feet. While surrounded by the field, a creature gains the following benefits:



{'type': 'list', 'style': 'list-hang-notitle', 'items': [{'type': 'item', 'name': 'Cover', 'entries': ['The creature has half cover.']}, {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Damage Resistance', 'entries': ['The creature has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison damage.']}, {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Evasion', 'entries': ['If the creature is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the creature instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.']}]}



As a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the field to another creature within 60 feet of the field.
