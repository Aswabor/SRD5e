# Forbiddance
*A 6th Level Abjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 10 Minute

**Range:** Point, Touch

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Day

You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the {@spell gate} spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the {@spell plane shift} spell.
