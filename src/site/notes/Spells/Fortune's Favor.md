You impart latent luck to yourself or one willing creature you can see within range.

Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the chosen creature, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll a {@dice d20} and choose which of the {@dice d20}s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
