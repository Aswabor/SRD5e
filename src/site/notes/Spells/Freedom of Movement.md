# Freedom of Movement
*A 4th Level Abjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, Touch

**Components:** V S M(a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by {@quickref difficult terrain||3}, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be {@condition paralyzed} or {@condition restrained}.
The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it {@condition grappled}. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.
