# Glyph of Warding
*A 3rd Level Abjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Hour

**Range:** Point, Touch

**Components:** V S M(incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Permanent

When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by {@scaledamage 5d8|3-9|1d8} for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.
