# Green-Flame Blade
*A Evocation Cantrip.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Radius, 5 Feet

**Components:** S 

**Duration:** Instant

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
