# Hail of Thorns
*A 1st Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Bonus

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

The next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack before the spell ends, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your ranged weapon or ammunition. In addition to the normal effect of the attack, the target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 1d10} piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At Higher Levels

If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 1d10|1-6|1d10} for each slot level above 1st (to a maximum of {@damage 6d10}).
