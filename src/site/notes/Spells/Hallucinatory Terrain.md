# Hallucinatory Terrain
*A 4th Level Illusion Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 10 Minute

**Range:** Point, 300 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)

**Duration:** Timed, 24 Hours

You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.
