# Haste
*A 3rd Level Transmutation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 30 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a shaving of licorice root)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the {@action Attack} (one weapon attack only), {@action Dash}, {@action Disengage}, {@action Hide}, or {@action Use an Object} action.
