# Healing Spirit
*A 2nd Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Bonus

**Range:** Point, 60 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).



Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore {@dice 1d6} hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can't heal constructs or undead. The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.



As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by {@scaledice 1d6|2-9|1d6} for each slot level above 2nd.
