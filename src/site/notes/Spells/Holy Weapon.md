You imbue a weapon you touch with holy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra {@damage 2d8} radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.
