# Hypnotic Pattern
*A 3rd Level Illusion Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 120 Feet

**Components:** S M(a glowing stick of incense or a crystal vial filled with phosphorescent material)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes {@condition charmed} for the duration. While {@condition charmed} by this spell, the creature is {@condition incapacitated} and has a speed of 0.
The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
