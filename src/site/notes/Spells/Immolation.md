# Immolation
*A 5th Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 90 Feet

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes {@damage 8d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the spell's duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes {@damage 4d6} fire damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one. These magical flames can't be extinguished by nonmagical means.
