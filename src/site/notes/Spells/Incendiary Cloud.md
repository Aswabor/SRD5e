# Incendiary Cloud
*A 8th Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 150 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.



When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 10d8} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.



The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.
