# Infestation
*A Conjuration Cantrip.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 30 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a living flea)

**Duration:** Instant

You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it takes {@damage 1d6} poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a {@dice d4} for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.
