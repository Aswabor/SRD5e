# Insect Plague
*A 5th Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 300 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Minutes

Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere's area is {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.
When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 4d10} piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 4d10|5-9|1d10} for each slot level above 5th.
