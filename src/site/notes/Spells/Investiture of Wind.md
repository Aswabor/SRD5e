If you are still flying when the spell ends, you fall, unless you can somehow prevent it.', 'You can use your action to create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you.

If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.']}
