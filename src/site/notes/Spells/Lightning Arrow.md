# Lightning Arrow
*A 3rd Level Transmutation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Bonus

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell's duration, the weapon's ammunition, or the weapon itself if it's a thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target takes {@damage 4d8} lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon's normal damage.
Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures takes {@damage 2d8} lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by {@scaledamage 4d8;2d8|3-9|1d8} for each slot level above 3rd.
