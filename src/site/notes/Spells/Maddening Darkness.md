# Maddening Darkness
*A 8th Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 150 Feet

**Components:** V M(a drop of pitch mixed with a drop of mercury)

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Minutes

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with {@sense darkvision} can't see through this darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.



Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking {@damage 8d8} psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
