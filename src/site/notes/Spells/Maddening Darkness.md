*A 8th Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 150 Feet

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with {@sense darkvision} can't see through this darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.
