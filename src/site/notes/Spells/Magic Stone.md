# Magic Stone
*A Transmutation Cantrip.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Bonus

**Range:** Point, Touch

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a {@item sling|phb}. If thrown, a pebble has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with a pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker's, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to {@damage 1d6} + your spellcasting ability modifier. Whether the attack hits or misses, the spell then ends on the stone.
