# Major Image
*A 3rd Level Illusion Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 120 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a bit of fleece)

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a {@creature troglodyte||troglodyte's} stench).

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.
