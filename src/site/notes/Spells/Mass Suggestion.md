# Mass Suggestion
*A 6th Level Enchantment Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 60 Feet

**Components:** V M(a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)

**Duration:** Timed, 24 Hours

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be {@condition charmed} are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.
