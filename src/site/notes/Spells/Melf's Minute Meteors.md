# Melf's Minute Meteors
*A 3rd Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** V S M(niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed into a bead)

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Minutes

You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell—and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter—you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 2d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.
