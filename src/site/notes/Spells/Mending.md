# Mending
*A Transmutation Cantrip.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Minute

**Range:** Point, Touch

**Components:** V S M(two lodestones)

**Duration:** Instant

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.
This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.
