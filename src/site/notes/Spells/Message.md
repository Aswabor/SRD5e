# Message
*A Transmutation Cantrip.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 120 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a short piece of copper wire)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Round

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.
