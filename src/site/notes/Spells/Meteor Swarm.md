# Meteor Swarm
*A 9th Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 1 Miles

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Instant

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes {@damage 20d6} fire damage and {@damage 20d6} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.
