# Mirage Arcane
*A 7th Level Illusion Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 10 Minute

**Range:** Point, Sight

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Days

You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain's general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.
