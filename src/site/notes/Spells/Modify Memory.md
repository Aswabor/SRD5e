# Modify Memory
*A 5th Level Enchantment Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 30 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes {@condition charmed} by you for the duration. The {@condition charmed} target is {@condition incapacitated} and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.

At Higher Levels

If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).
