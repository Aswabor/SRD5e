# Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum
*A 4th Level Abjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 10 Minute

**Range:** Point, 120 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)

**Duration:** Timed, 24 Hours

You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.
