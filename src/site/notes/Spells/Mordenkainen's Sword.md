# Mordenkainen's Sword
*A 7th Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 60 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.



When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 3d10} force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.
