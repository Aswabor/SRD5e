# Pass without Trace
*A 2nd Level Abjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** V S M(ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.
