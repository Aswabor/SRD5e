# Planar Ally
*A 6th Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 10 Minute

**Range:** Point, 60 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Instant

You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a {@filter celestial|bestiary|type=celestial|miscellaneous=!swarm}, an {@filter elemental|bestiary|type=elemental|miscellaneous=!swarm}, or a {@filter fiend|bestiary|type=fiend|miscellaneous=!swarm} loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).
