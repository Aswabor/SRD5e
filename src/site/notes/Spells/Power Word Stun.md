# Power Word Stun
*A 8th Level Enchantment Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 60 Feet

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instant

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is {@condition stunned}. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.
The {@condition stunned} target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.
