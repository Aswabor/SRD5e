**Duration:** Instant

You channel primal magic to cause your teeth or fingernails to sharpen, ready to deliver a corrosive attack. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 1d10} acid damage. After you make the attack, your teeth or fingernails return to normal.



The spell's damage increases by {@dice 1d10} when you reach 5th level ({@damage 2d10}), 11th level ({@damage 3d10}), and 17th level ({@damage 4d10}).
