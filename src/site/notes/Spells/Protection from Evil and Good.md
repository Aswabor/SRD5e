# Protection from Evil and Good
*A 1st Level Abjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, Touch

**Components:** V S M(holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.
The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be {@condition charmed}, {@condition frightened}, or possessed by them. If the target is already {@condition charmed}, {@condition frightened}, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
