# Rary's Telepathic Bond
*A 5th Level Divination Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 30 Feet

**Components:** V S M(pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Hour

You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this spell.



Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can't extend to other planes of existence.
