# Reincarnate
*A 5th Level Transmutation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Hour

**Range:** Point, Touch

**Components:** V S M(rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Instant

You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.
