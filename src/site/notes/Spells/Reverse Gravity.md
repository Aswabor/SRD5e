# Reverse Gravity
*A 7th Level Transmutation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 100 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a lodestone and iron filings)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.
