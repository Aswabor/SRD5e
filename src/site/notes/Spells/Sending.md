# Sending
*A 3rd Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, Unlimited

**Components:** V S M(a short piece of fine copper wire)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Round

You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.
You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a {@chance 5|5 percent} chance that the message doesn't arrive.
