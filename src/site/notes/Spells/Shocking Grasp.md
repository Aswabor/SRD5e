# Shocking Grasp
*A Evocation Cantrip.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Instant

Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 1d8} lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.
