# Silence
*A 2nd Level Illusion Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 120 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are {@condition deafened} while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.
