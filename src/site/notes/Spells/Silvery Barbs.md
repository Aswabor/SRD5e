# Silvery Barbs
*A 1st Level Enchantment Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Reaction

**Range:** Point, 60 Feet

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instant

You magically distract the triggering creature and turn its momentary uncertainty into encouragement for another creature. The triggering creature must reroll the {@dice d20} and use the lower roll.



You can then choose a different creature you can see within range (you can choose yourself). The chosen creature has advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this spell at a time.
