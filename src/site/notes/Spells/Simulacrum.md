# Simulacrum
*A 7th Level Illusion Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 12 Hour

**Range:** Point, Touch

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Permanent

You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature's hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.
