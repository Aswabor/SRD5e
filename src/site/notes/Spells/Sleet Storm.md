# Sleet Storm
*A 3rd Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 150 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.
The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls {@condition prone}.
If a creature starts its turn in the spell's area and is concentrating on a spell, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.
