# Snilloc's Snowball Swarm
*A 2nd Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 90 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a piece of ice or a small white rock chip)

**Duration:** Instant

A flurry of magic snowballs erupts from a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 3d6} cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d6|2-9|1d6} for each slot level above 2nd.
