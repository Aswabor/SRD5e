# Soul Cage
*A 6th Level Necromancy Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Reaction

**Range:** Point, 60 Feet

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Timed, 8 Hours

This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside the tiny cage you use for the material component. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the spell ends or until you destroy the cage, which ends the spell. While you have a soul inside the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends. While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can't be revived.
