# Spike Growth
*A 2nd Level Transmutation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 150 Feet

**Components:** V S M(seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Minutes

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes {@damage 2d4} piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.



The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
