You call forth spirits of the dead, which flit around you for the spell's duration. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable.

In addition, any creature of your choice that you can see that starts its turn within 10 feet of you has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 1d8|3,5,7,9|1d8} for every two slot levels above 3rd.
