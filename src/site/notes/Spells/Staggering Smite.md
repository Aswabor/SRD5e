# Staggering Smite
*A 4th Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Bonus

**Range:** Point, Self

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon pierces both body and mind, and the attack deals an extra {@damage 4d6} psychic damage to the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't take reactions, until the end of its next turn.
