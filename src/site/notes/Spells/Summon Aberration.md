# Summon Aberration
*A 4th Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 90 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a pickled tentacle and an eyeball in a platinum-inlaid vial worth at least 400 gp)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Hour

You call forth an aberrant spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the {@creature Aberrant Spirit|TCE} stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Beholderkin, Slaad, or Star Spawn. The creature resembles an aberration of that kind, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.
