You call forth a bestial spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the {@creature Bestial Spirit|TCE} stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an environment: Air, Land, or Water. The creature resembles an animal of your choice that is native to the chosen environment, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
