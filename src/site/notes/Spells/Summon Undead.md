# Summon Undead
*A 3rd Level Necromancy Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 90 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a gilded skull worth at least 300 gp)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Hour

You call forth an undead spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the {@creature Undead Spirit|TCE} stat block. When you cast the spell, choose the creature's form: Ghostly, Putrid, or Skeletal. The spirit resembles an undead creature with the chosen form, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.
