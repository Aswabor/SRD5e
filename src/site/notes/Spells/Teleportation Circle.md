# Teleportation Circle
*A 5th Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Minute

**Range:** Point, 10 Feet

**Components:** V M(rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Round

As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
