# Thunder Step
*A 3rd Level Conjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 90 Feet

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instant

You teleport yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within range. Immediately after you disappear, a thunderous boom sounds, and each creature within 10 feet of the space you left must make a Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 3d10} thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The thunder can be heard from up to 300 feet away.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d10|3-9|1d10} for each slot level above 3rd.
