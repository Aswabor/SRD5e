# Toll the Dead
*A Necromancy Cantrip.*

**Components:** V S 

**Duration:** Instant

You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take {@damage 1d8} necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes {@damage 1d12} necrotic damage.
