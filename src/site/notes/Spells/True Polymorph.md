# True Polymorph
*A 9th Level Transmutation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 30 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Hour

Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into a nonmagical object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.
