# Vicious Mockery
*A Enchantment Cantrip.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 60 Feet

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instant

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take {@damage 1d4} psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.



This spell's damage increases by {@dice 1d4} when you reach 5th level ({@damage 2d4}), 11th level ({@damage 3d4}), and 17th level ({@damage 4d4}).
