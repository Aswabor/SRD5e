# Wall of Fire
*A 4th Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 120 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a small piece of phosphorus)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Minute

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.



When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 5d8} fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.



One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals {@damage 5d8} fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 5d8|4-9|1d8} for each slot level above 4th.
