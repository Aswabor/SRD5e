# Wall of Ice
*A 6th Level Evocation Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, 120 Feet

**Components:** V S M(a small piece of quartz)

**Duration:** Timed, 10 Minutes

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by {@scaledamage 10d6|6-9|2d6}, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by {@scaledamage 5d6|6-9|1d6}, for each slot level above 6th.
