# Warding Bond
*A 2nd Level Abjuration Spell.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Point, Touch

**Components:** V S M(a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)

**Duration:** Timed, 1 Hour

This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.
